I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at University of Houston. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in AI-EDGE Institute at The Ohio State University, advised by [Prof. Ness Shroff](http://newslab.ece.ohio-state.edu/home/index.html), [Prof. Yingbin Liang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home), and [Prof. Anish Arora](https://cse.osu.edu/people/arora.9). I received my B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2013, my M.S. degree in Telecommunications from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2014, and my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University, in 2021, under the co-supervision of [Prof. Junshan Zhang](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/) and [Prof. Lei Ying](https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/).

**Multiple openings for fully funded Ph.D. students are available:**
Students who are self-motivated, hard-working, and have research interests in Machine Learning, Optimization and Wireless Communication are very welcomed to apply. Please send me an email with your CV and transcripts if you are interested.   
(Due to the large volume of inquiry emails, unfortunately I am not able to respond to every email. If you have sent me an email and not received a response, I hope you will understand.)

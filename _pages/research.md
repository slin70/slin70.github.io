## Research interests

My research interests fall in general machine learning and optimization, in terms of algorithm design, theory, and the applications in various domains, under the central objective of making AI more practical, accessible, adaptive, and explainable. The current research topics in my group include 

* Warm-start and continual RL
* RL for foundation models and foundation models for RL
* Theory and principled algorithm design for continual learning
* Mixture-of-experts
* Bilevel optimization.

The application domains include wireless edge networks, computer graphics, physics, etc.

## Research interests

My research interests fall in general machine learning and optimization, in terms of algorithm design, theory, and the applications in various domains, under the central objective of making AI more practical, adaptive, accessible, and explainable. The current research topics in my group include 

* **Large Language Models**: continual adaptation, efficient/safe alignment, and explanation
* **Agentic AI**: self-evolving agents and multi-agent collaboration
* **Multi-model LLMs**: long-video understanding
* **Continual Learning**: theory and practical algorithm design
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Warm-start and continual RL
* **Bilevel optimization**.

The application domains include computer vision, wireless edge networks, IoT, healthcare, security, physics, etc.

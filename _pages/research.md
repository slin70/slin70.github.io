## Research interests

My research interests fall in general machine learning and optimization, in terms of algorithm design, theory, and the applications in various domains, under the central objective of making AI more practical, accessible, adaptive, and explainable. The current research topics in my group include 

* **Reinforcement Learning**: Warm-start and continual RL
* **Continual Learning**: theory and practical algorithm design
* **Foundation models**: continual adaptation, alignment, and explanation
* **Mixture-of-experts**
* **Bilevel optimization**.

The application domains include IoT, wireless edge networks, energy, security, computer graphics, etc.
